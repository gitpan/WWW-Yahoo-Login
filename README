The tests for this module require a live internet connection. If one 
isn't present then they'll be skipped. Some of the tests require 
environment variables to be set with a Yahoo user ID and password. These
are WYL_USER and WYL_PASS respectively. If these aren't present then
the relevant tests will be skipped.
